# Velar Mobile App v2 — Implementation Spec (from Claude Design source)

Source: Claude Design project `6f29813d-e9c1-48a3-bd73-8d1567258312`, file `Velar Mobile App v2.dc.html` (all 12 screens + design-system section), device chrome cross-checked against `android-frame.jsx`. `Velar Mobile App.dc.html` (v1) intentionally superseded — see §7.

## 0. Product framing (verbatim from source intro copy)

> "A financial analyst in your pocket. Rebuilt around periods and signals instead of files and sections — dark money surfaces, light reading surfaces, one luminous accent, tabular numerals throughout."

- **CUT FROM V1**: statement-card shelf on Home, desktop drag-and-drop upload sheet, decorative donut, 4-tab bar with a data table as a peer of Home.
- **NEW MODEL**: A statement becomes a **period**, switched from one header pill. Home answers three questions in order: what came in and out, what should I know, where did it go.
- **BACKED BY REAL ENDPOINTS**: Every number maps to `statements/{id}/analytics`, `/insights`, `/transactions`, `jobs/{id}`, `/v1/feedback`. No invented capabilities.

Bottom nav is **3 tabs only**: Overview, Signals, Activity. Profile ("You") is reached via avatar tap, not a tab. No donut/pie chart, no desktop drag-drop.

## 1. Screen inventory

| # | Screen | Group |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Overview — flow → signals → breakdown | 01 The Period Loop |
| 02 | Period switcher — replaces the file list | 01 The Period Loop |
| 03 | Category drill-down | 01 The Period Loop |
| 04 | Activity — sticky filters, day totals, skeleton row | 01 The Period Loop |
| 05 | Transaction sheet — grounded explanation + feedback | 01 The Period Loop |
| 06 | Signals — headline + ranked, typed insights | 02 Intelligence |
| 07 | Recurring — rhythm strip, not a list | 02 Intelligence |
| 08 | You — dark mode (Profile/Settings) | 02 Intelligence |
| 09 | First run — empty state doing the teaching | 03 First Run & System States |
| 10 | Uploading — native picker result, early validation | 03 First Run & System States |
| 11 | Analysing — job stages as progress you can read | 03 First Run & System States |
| 12 | Rejected file — error that fixes itself | 03 First Run & System States |

All screens mocked in an `AndroidDevice` frame, 412×892, 18px bezel radius, 8px border `rgba(116,119,117,.5)`. Frame chrome: 40px status bar (clock left, camera punch-hole center, signal/wifi/battery right), 24px gesture nav bar (108×4px pill, centered). No Material top app-bar used anywhere — every screen builds its own custom header.

### 2.2 Typography

Fonts: **Space Grotesk** (500/600/700, amounts & headlines), **Instrument Sans** (400/500/600/700, body), **IBM Plex Mono** (400/500/600, micro-labels/meta/tabular). Global `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.

| Role | Font/weight | Size/line-height | Tracking |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hero amount | Space Grotesk 700 | 44/1 (Home) · 40/1 (Recurring) · 36/1 (drill-down) · 34 (Analysing %) | −0.02 to −0.03em |
| Screen title | Space Grotesk 700 | 24 | −0.02em |
| Big headline | Space Grotesk 700 | 32/1.2 · 26/1.25 · 22/1.3 | −0.02 to −0.03em |
| Signal body | Instrument Sans 500 | 17/1.45 | — |
| Card body | Instrument Sans 500 | 15/1.45 | — |
| Row label | Instrument Sans 600 | 14-14.5 | — |
| Row meta | IBM Plex Mono 500 | 11.5-12 | slight |
| Micro label (ALL CAPS) | IBM Plex Mono 600 | 10.5-11 | +0.1 to +0.12em |
| Buttons | Instrument Sans 600 | 12-15 | — |

Currency: `₹` symbol, Indian comma grouping (`₹80,634`), true minus before symbol for negatives (`−₹4,500`), tabular numerals. Dates: `28 JUN · SUN`, `04:47 PM`, `Jan – Jun 2026`, `28 JUN 2026 · 04:47 PM`.

### 2.3 Spacing / radius / elevation

- Spacing scale: 4·8·12·16·22·26·32px. Screen gutter = **22px**.
- Radius: 8 (chip) · 12 (field) · 18 (card) · 28 (sheet, top corners only) · pill/100 (buttons, badges, avatars, nav, toggles).
- Elevation: Flat `0 1px 2px oklch(0 0 0/.05)`; Card `0 1px 2px oklch(0 0 0/.04), 0 14px 30px -18px oklch(0 0 0/.18)`; Sheet `0 -20px 60px -20px oklch(0 0 0/.35)` or `0 18px 40px -14px oklch(0 0 0/.5)` (floating nav). **Dark mode uses hairlines only, never shadows.**

### 2.4 Motion

| Interaction | Spec |
|---|---|
| Signal reveal | 6px rise + fade, 240ms, 60ms stagger |
| Chart draw | Bars grow from baseline, 420ms `cubic-bezier(.2,.8,.2,1)`, left→right |
| Period switch | Numbers count-morph 300ms, hero hue crossfades, **no page slide** |
| Progress ring | Sweeps to each job stage, never loops idly |
| Haptics | Light tick on period switch/filter change; success thud on analysis complete; nothing else |
| Pull to refresh | Only re-polls an in-flight job; completed periods are immutable |

Keyframes: `vshimmer` (skeleton sweep, 1.4s linear infinite), `vpulse` (opacity .35↔.9 + scale 1↔1.35, 1.4-1.6s ease-in-out infinite — analysing dots, live period indicator), `vsweep` (diagonal progress-bar shine, 1.5s ease-in-out infinite), `vrise` (entrance: opacity 0→1, translateY 6px→0, .4s ease both, staggered delay).

### 2.5 Accessibility rules

Amount color never the only signal (±sign + icon also carry direction). Body text ≥4.5:1 contrast. Tap targets ≥44px (floating nav clears OS gesture area). Category hues stay distinguishable in deuteranopia because rank/label/amount are always co-present. Reduced-motion drops rise/sweep animations, shows final states instantly.

## 3. Screen-by-screen spec

### 01 · Overview (Home) — dark frame
1. **Header** (bg ink900, padding 6/22/26px):
   - Period pill (dot + "Jan – Jun 2026" + ▾caret, ink800 bg, hairline-d border, pill radius) → tap opens **Period switcher (02)**.
   - Bell icon button (34px circle, ink800, unread dot) + Avatar chip "AK" (34px, gradient accent→accent-dim) → tap avatar → **You (08)**.
   - Label "NET FLOW · 6 MONTHS" (mono 11px tracked).
   - Hero "−₹51,659" (44/1) + delta chip "▲ 12%" (rose tint).
   - Split flow bar: 8px pill, two proportional segments — Sent (rose→orange gradient, flex 80634) / Received (accent, flex 28975).
   - Stat row: SENT ₹80,634 (left) / RECEIVED ₹28,975 (right, accent-dim color).
   - Reconciliation pill: "✓ Reconciled against the statement's own totals".

     - "Show 4 more categories" link (8 categories exist total).
   - Tapping a category row → **Category drill-down (03)**.
3. **Floating bottom nav pill** (3 segments: Overview[active] / Signals / Activity).

Empty-state variant of this screen = **First run (09)** when zero periods.

### 02 · Period switcher — modal sheet over Overview, dark
Sheet (ink850, radius 28/28/0/0). Title "Choose a period" + subtitle. 3 rows:
1. Selected/current "Jan – Jun 2026" / "184 txns · ₹80,634 out" — highlighted (ink700 bg, accent border, checkmark badge).
2. In-progress "Jul 2026" — pulsing dot + "ANALYSING · 64%" (amber, vpulse) → tap → **Analysing (11)**.
3. Past "Jul – Dec 2025" / "203 txns · ₹91,120 out".
Add-statement row (dashed border): "+" tile + "Add a statement" / "Google Pay → Transaction statement → PDF" → **Upload flow (10)**.

Selecting a completed period switches Overview's data (count-morph 300ms, no slide) and closes the sheet.

### 03 · Category drill-down — light body, dark-painted header
Header (ink900): back "‹" → **Overview (01)** / "Jan – Jun 2026" centered / "⋯" more-menu. Category label (dot + "Food"). Hero "₹16,736" (36/1) + delta chip "↓ 18%" (accent tint).

Body grouped by day, day header = date + day total:
- "28 JUN · SUN" / total "−₹4,950" — Toni and Guy (violet avatar "T") "−₹4,500" + "UNUSUAL" badge (amber) → tap → **Transaction sheet (05)**; Swiggy (accent avatar "S") "−₹450".
- "27 JUN · SAT" / total "+₹41,690" (accent-dim, positive day) — Salary credit ("↓" accent icon) "+₹42,000"; Uber (sky avatar "U") "−₹310".
- Skeleton loading row (shimmer placeholder) representing lazy pagination.

### 05 · Transaction sheet — modal sheet over Activity, light
Sheet (card/white, radius 28/28/0/0). Header: avatar "T" (46px violet) — Toni and Guy / "28 JUN 2026 · 04:47 PM" — amount "−₹4,500" (22px).

Footer: "Your correction trains Velar's merchant memory."

### 06 · Signals — dark, full screen
Header: "Signals" (24px) / "JAN–JUN 2026".
Headline card (accent gradient): "You spent ₹80,634 across six months and kept ₹28,975 coming in. Food and travel are 54% of everything — and both are trending down."
Filter chips: All 5[active] / Watch 2 / Good 2.
Signal cards (ink850, radius 18):
1. WATCH/ANOMALY: "Salon spend jumped to ₹4,500 — 18× your usual ₹250 visit." Evidence row: "z-score 4.8 · 6 visits observed" + "Open" link → **Transaction sheet (05)**.
2. GOOD/TREND: "Food spend fell 18% versus your previous statement, saving about ₹3,600."
3. WATCH/RECURRING: "Two subscriptions bill ₹698 every month — 1.3% of your outflow." → tap → **Recurring (07)**.
4. CONTEXT: "Uber was your most frequent merchant — 34 rides at ₹150 average."
Footer: "Signals are written from your computed analytics only. If a figure isn't in your statement, Velar won't claim it."
Note: header count (All 5/Watch 2/Good 2) is a mock placeholder inconsistency (only 4 cards shown) — build the list dynamically counted from real signal data, don't hardcode counts.

### 07 · Recurring — dark header / light body
Header: back "‹" + "Recurring" → **Signals (06)**. Label "COMMITTED EVERY MONTH". Hero "₹698" (40/1). Stat row: DETECTED 2 / SHARE OF OUTFLOW 1.3% / NEXT 7 DAYS ₹499 (amber).

## 6. Backend endpoint mapping

- `statements/{id}/analytics` → Overview hero/flow bar/category breakdown
- `statements/{id}/insights` → Signals screen + Overview "Signals" preview
- `statements/{id}/transactions` → Activity list + Category drill-down merchant list
- `jobs/{id}` → Uploading/Analysing progress polling
- `/v1/feedback` → Transaction sheet "Looks right"/"Wrong category"

(Note: the mock copy references `statements/{id}/analytics` etc. directly, but per API_REFERENCE.md the actual paths are `/statements/{id}/analytics` — no discrepancy, just path-root notation.)

## 7. Explicitly excluded (do not build)

No statement-card shelf on Home. No desktop drag-and-drop upload sheet. No decorative donut/pie chart anywhere. No 4-tab bottom nav (strictly 3: Overview/Signals/Activity). No data-table screen as a peer of Home. Profile/Settings is avatar-accessed, not tab-accessed.
