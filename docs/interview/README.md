# Velar — Senior Engineer Interview Question Bank

204 questions, organized into 13 categories, generated entirely from this codebase's actual implementation — every question references a real file, function, bug, or design decision documented elsewhere in `/docs`. None of these are generic framework trivia; if you can't answer a question by reasoning about *this specific code*, that's the point.

## Two honest deviations from a generic template

- **"Frontend"** — this repository contains **no frontend code at all** (confirmed across every prior documentation pass: no HTML, JS, templates, or static assets beyond one banner image). Rather than invent frontend questions about code that doesn't exist, this category is reframed as **"Frontend / Client Integration"** — testing whether a candidate can reason about what Velar's actual API contract, auth model, and response inconsistencies imply for *any* client that would consume it (browser, mobile, or another backend).
- **"State Management"** — not React/Redux state. Velar has a genuine, first-class domain state machine (the Phase 4 memory engine: `EPHEMERAL → TEMPORARY → PERMANENT → ARCHIVED`), plus several architectural "state" patterns worth interrogating (singletons as implicit application state, in-memory rate-limiter state, an in-memory graph that's lost on restart). This category tests understanding of *that*.

## How to use this bank

Each question includes:
| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty** | Easy / Medium / Hard / Expert |
| **Importance** | 1–10 — how load-bearing this concept is to understanding the system correctly |
| **Expected Answer** | What a candidate who has genuinely read and understood this code would say |
| **Follow-ups** | Where an interviewer would push next |
| **Common Mistakes** | What most candidates get wrong, and why |
| **What This Tests** | The underlying competency being probed, beyond the surface question |
| **Red Flags** | Answers that indicate the candidate is guessing, pattern-matching from generic knowledge, or hasn't actually read the code |
| **Excellent Answer** | What separates a senior-level response from a merely correct one |
| **Poor Answer** | A concrete example of a response that sounds plausible but is wrong or shallow |

## Suggested interview structure

A 60-minute senior-level system interview using this bank might draw: 2 Architecture, 3 Backend, 3 Database, 2 Authentication, 2 Security, 2 Design Decisions, 1 API, 1 State Management, 1 Edge Case — roughly 17 questions, weighted toward the categories where this codebase has the most genuine depth (Backend and Database), using Follow-ups to go deeper on whichever 3-4 the candidate answers best.

Every question here is traceable to a specific finding in [`docs/16-known-issues-tech-debt.md`](../16-known-issues-tech-debt.md), [`docs/17-senior-architect-review.md`](../17-senior-architect-review.md), [`docs/18-database-analysis.md`](../18-database-analysis.md), or the per-file/per-folder/per-endpoint references. Where a question is about a bug, the doc citation is the answer key.
