# Authentication — 15 Questions

---

### AU1. Walk through exactly what `core/security.py::validate_api_key` does, line by line, including what it returns and why that return value is essentially meaningless.
- **Difficulty:** Medium | **Importance:** 9
- **Expected Answer:** It extracts the `X-Velar-API-Key` header via `APIKeyHeader(auto_error=False)`. If absent, raises `HTTPException(401, ...)`. If present but not exactly equal to the hardcoded literal `"velar_test_key_123"`, raises `HTTPException(403, ...)`. If it matches, returns the string `"developer_id_789"` — a fixed, fake identity token. This return value is meaningless because every router attaches this function via `dependencies=[Depends(validate_api_key)]` rather than binding it to a handler parameter with `Depends(...)`, so the returned value is computed and then simply discarded on every single request.
- **Follow-ups:** "What would you need to change to actually use that identity downstream?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Assuming the returned identity is used somewhere for logging, auditing, or authorization — it is not, anywhere in the codebase.
- **What This Tests:** Whether the candidate traced the *usage* of a return value, not just the function that produces it — a common gap in code review.
- **Red Flags:** Assumes the identity string does something without verifying.
- **Excellent Answer:** Notes that fixing this would require every router to use `Depends(validate_api_key)` bound to a parameter (e.g., `caller_id: str = Depends(validate_api_key)`) instead of the current `dependencies=[...]` pattern, and that `validate_api_key` itself would need to resolve a *real*, distinct identity per key rather than a hardcoded literal for this to be meaningful at all.
- **Poor Answer:** Correctly describes the 401/403 logic but doesn't notice the return value is unused.

---

### AU2. Why does rotating `VELAR_API_KEY` in `.env` have zero effect on what key is actually accepted?
- **Difficulty:** Easy | **Importance:** 10
- **Expected Answer:** `core/security.py` never reads `settings.VELAR_API_KEY` at all — it compares the incoming header against the hardcoded string literal `"velar_test_key_123"` directly in the source code. `VELAR_API_KEY` is declared as a required setting in `core/config.py` and validated at startup, but the value that's actually validated is never consulted by the authentication logic.
- **Follow-ups:** "How would you fix this with the smallest possible diff?" "Why do you think `VELAR_API_KEY` is required at startup if it's never used?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Assuming there must be some indirect path connecting the setting to the check (e.g., an environment variable read elsewhere) without verifying.
- **What This Tests:** Whether the candidate actually reads `core/security.py`'s literal comparison rather than assuming a sensibly-named setting must be wired correctly.
- **Red Flags:** Assumes the setting is used because it exists and is named appropriately.
- **Excellent Answer:** Gives the one-line fix (`if api_key_header != settings.VELAR_API_KEY:`) and speculates that `VELAR_API_KEY` being required at startup despite being unused suggests it was *intended* to be wired up and the connection was simply never made — a "half-finished feature" pattern consistent with several other gaps in this codebase.
- **Poor Answer:** Identifies the bug but can't state the fix precisely.

---

### AU3. Is `if api_key_header != "velar_test_key_123":` a secure way to compare API keys? Why or why not?
- **Difficulty:** Hard | **Importance:** 6
- **Expected Answer:** Not ideally — Python's `!=` on strings is not a constant-time comparison; it can short-circuit as soon as a differing character is found, meaning comparison time can vary based on how many leading characters match, in theory enabling a timing side-channel attack to guess the key character by character. The real-world severity here is low today, since the key is trivially discoverable from the source code itself, but the pattern itself is bad practice that would matter once a real, secret key is in play.
- **Follow-ups:** "What's the correct function to use instead, and why does it matter that it takes constant time regardless of match length?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Dismissing the timing-attack concern entirely as "theoretical and doesn't matter," without acknowledging it's a real, known, documented class of vulnerability (even if low-severity in this specific instance).
- **What This Tests:** Knowledge of a real, if often-overlooked, security best practice (constant-time comparison for secrets) and the judgment to correctly calibrate its actual severity in this specific context.
- **Red Flags:** Either overstates this as a critical vulnerability, or dismisses it entirely with no nuance about severity depending on context.
- **Excellent Answer:** Names `hmac.compare_digest` or `secrets.compare_digest` as the correct constant-time replacement, and correctly notes the severity here is low *specifically because* the current key is hardcoded and public in the repository — but that the same code pattern would become a real risk the moment `VELAR_API_KEY` is actually wired up to a genuine secret (see AU2).
- **Poor Answer:** Either "this is a critical vulnerability" (overstated) or "it doesn't matter at all" (understated) with no contextual reasoning.

---

### AU4. Why does `GET /health` and `GET /metrics` have no authentication, while every other endpoint does?
- **Difficulty:** Medium | **Importance:** 6
- **Expected Answer:** Both are registered directly on `app` (`app.get("/health", ...)` and via the Prometheus instrumentator's `expose()` call), outside of any `include_router(..., dependencies=[Depends(validate_api_key)])` call — the only mechanism through which auth is applied in this codebase. This is a common and defensible pattern: infrastructure tooling (load balancers, container orchestrators, Prometheus scrapers) may not carry an application-level API key, so basic liveness and metrics are conventionally left open.
- **Follow-ups:** "What information does `/health` leak to an unauthenticated caller that might be sensitive?" "Should `/metrics` be exposed publicly?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Assuming this is an oversight/bug rather than a common, deliberate infrastructure pattern.
- **What This Tests:** Recognizing a legitimate exception to a security rule rather than flagging every exception as a defect.
- **Red Flags:** Calls this a security bug without engaging with the legitimate operational reasons for the exception.
- **Excellent Answer:** Notes that `/health`'s response *does* leak some operational detail to any unauthenticated caller — raw exception text from failed dependency checks (e.g., a MongoDB connection error message) — which is a genuine, if minor, information-disclosure consideration worth weighing against the operational convenience.
- **Poor Answer:** Treats the lack of auth on these two endpoints as unambiguously wrong.

### AU5. Explain the practical difference between `HTTPException(401, ...)` and `HTTPException(403, ...)` as used in this codebase, and whether the distinction is meaningful here.
- **Difficulty:** Medium | **Importance:** 5
- **Expected Answer:** `401` (missing header) conventionally means "you haven't authenticated at all"; `403` (wrong key) conventionally means "you authenticated, but you're not authorized" — though in this codebase's single-shared-key model, there's no real distinction between "authenticated" and "authorized," since there's no authorization layer at all. The distinction is semantically correct (missing vs. wrong credential) but doesn't map to any deeper authorization concept the way it would in a system with real per-user permissions.
- **Follow-ups:** "In a system with real roles/permissions, when would you use 403 differently?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Conflating 401 and 403 as interchangeable, or assuming this codebase's usage implies a real authorization model exists.
- **What This Tests:** Correct understanding of the 401 vs. 403 semantic distinction in HTTP, applied honestly to a system that doesn't have real authorization to distinguish.
- **Red Flags:** Says 401 and 403 mean the same thing, or invents an authorization distinction that doesn't exist in this codebase.
- **Excellent Answer:** Notes that if real per-caller authorization were added (e.g., different API keys with different scopes), 403 would become meaningful in the traditional sense — "you're a valid, authenticated caller, but not allowed to do *this specific* action" — which today's single-key model can't express at all.
- **Poor Answer:** Gives the textbook 401-vs-403 definition without connecting it to this specific codebase's actual (lack of) authorization model.

---

### AU6. If every caller uses the exact same API key, how would you distinguish which client made a given request in server logs?
- **Difficulty:** Medium | **Importance:** 7
- **Expected Answer:** You currently can't, at the application layer — there's no per-caller identity captured anywhere (see AU1). The only distinguishing signal available is the request's source IP address, which SlowAPI's rate limiter already uses for throttling, but nothing in this codebase logs or correlates IP address with specific actions taken.
- **Follow-ups:** "How would you add per-caller attribution with the least disruptive change?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Assuming the `X-Velar-API-Key` header itself provides attribution — it only proves "you know the one shared secret," not "you are caller X specifically."
- **What This Tests:** Recognizing the practical operational consequence of a shared-secret auth model — no per-caller audit trail.
- **Red Flags:** Assumes attribution is somehow already possible.
- **Excellent Answer:** Proposes issuing distinct API keys per client (a map of key → identity, checked in `validate_api_key`) as the minimal change that would restore attribution without a full OAuth2/JWT redesign.
- **Poor Answer:** Jumps straight to "implement OAuth2" without acknowledging a much smaller, faster fix exists for the immediate need.

---

### AU7. Why is `APIKeyHeader(auto_error=False)` used instead of the FastAPI default (`auto_error=True`)?
- **Difficulty:** Medium | **Importance:** 5
- **Expected Answer:** `auto_error=True` would make FastAPI raise its own generic 403 automatically the instant the header is missing, before the function body ever runs — which would prevent `validate_api_key` from distinguishing "missing" (401) from "wrong" (403) with custom messages, since it would never even get control for the missing-header case. `auto_error=False` lets the header be `None` without an automatic exception, so the function itself can inspect that and raise the more specific, intentional error.
- **Follow-ups:** "What would the client-observable difference be if this were changed to `auto_error=True`?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Assuming `auto_error` only affects logging or has no functional impact on status codes.
- **What This Tests:** Precise understanding of a specific FastAPI security-utility parameter, not just general auth flow knowledge.
- **Red Flags:** Can't explain what `auto_error` actually controls.
- **Excellent Answer:** Notes the client-observable difference would be subtle but real: a missing-header request would get a generic FastAPI-generated 403 with FastAPI's default message instead of this codebase's specific "Missing X-Velar-API-Key header" 401 message — losing the more informative distinction.
- **Poor Answer:** Vague "it changes the error behavior" without specifics.

---

### AU8. Design a minimal, incremental path from today's single shared API key to real per-user authentication, without a full rewrite.
- **Difficulty:** Expert | **Importance:** 8
- **Expected Answer:** A reasonable staged approach: (1) Replace the single hardcoded key with a lookup table (initially even a simple dict or a new MongoDB collection) mapping distinct API keys to identities, fixing attribution (AU6) with minimal change. (2) Change `validate_api_key` to return the real resolved identity and change routers to use `Depends(validate_api_key)` bound to a parameter instead of `dependencies=[...]`. (3) Thread that identity through to replace hardcoded values like `TEST_USER = "user_123"` in `routers/analytics.py`. (4) Only then consider a heavier mechanism (JWT/OAuth2) if session-based or third-party-delegated auth becomes a real requirement.
- **Follow-ups:** "What would break if you skipped step 2 and went straight to threading a hardcoded identity through?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Jumping straight to "implement OAuth2/JWT" as the first step, without recognizing that steps 1-3 deliver most of the practical value (attribution, authorization groundwork) at a fraction of the implementation cost and risk.
- **What This Tests:** Incremental, risk-aware system design — a hallmark of senior engineering judgment vs. reaching for the most sophisticated tool immediately.
- **Red Flags:** Proposes a full auth-system rewrite as the only path, with no incremental option considered.
- **Excellent Answer:** Explicitly sequences the changes by risk and value, and notes that step 3 (removing `TEST_USER`) is the one that actually delivers user-visible correctness — the earlier steps are prerequisites, not the goal itself.
- **Poor Answer:** Lists disconnected auth-related buzzwords (OAuth2, JWT, refresh tokens) without a coherent incremental sequence.

---

### AU9. Why does SlowAPI's rate limiter key by IP address rather than by API key or resolved identity?
- **Difficulty:** Medium | **Importance:** 5
- **Expected Answer:** `core/rate_limiter.py` uses `get_remote_address` as its key function — a default, framework-provided choice that doesn't require any auth-aware logic. Since every caller currently shares one API key anyway, keying by API key would be functionally equivalent to no per-client differentiation at all (everyone would share one bucket); IP-based keying at least distinguishes *some* callers from each other, even without real identity.
- **Follow-ups:** "What would change about rate limiting once real per-caller API keys exist (per AU8)?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Assuming keying by API key would automatically be an improvement given the current single-shared-key setup — it would actually be worse (one shared bucket for literally everyone) until AU8's fix is in place.
- **What This Tests:** Recognizing that a rate-limiting strategy's correctness depends on what's actually available to key on, given the current auth model's limitations.
- **Red Flags:** Recommends switching to API-key-based rate limiting without acknowledging today's single-key setup would make this worse, not better.
- **Excellent Answer:** Notes that once AU8's per-caller keys exist, switching the rate limiter's key function to the resolved identity would be a natural and valuable follow-on improvement, since it would then correctly distinguish legitimate high-volume clients from potential abuse regardless of shared network egress IPs (e.g., multiple users behind one corporate NAT).
- **Poor Answer:** Doesn't connect this question to the current auth model's constraints at all.

### AU10. What happens, precisely, if a client sends `X-Velar-API-Key: ` (the header present but with an empty string value)?
- **Difficulty:** Medium | **Importance:** 4
- **Expected Answer:** `APIKeyHeader` would extract an empty string, not `None` — so the `if not api_key_header:` check in `validate_api_key` would actually catch this case too, since an empty string is falsy in Python, correctly routing to the 401 "missing" response rather than falling through to the 403 "wrong key" comparison.
- **Follow-ups:** "What if the header were sent as literally the string `'None'` or `'null'`?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Assuming an empty-but-present header would be treated differently from a fully absent header.
- **What This Tests:** Precise reasoning about Python truthiness and how it interacts with the specific `if not ...:` check used here.
- **Red Flags:** Assumes an empty string would fall through to the 403 branch.
- **Excellent Answer:** Correctly traces that `not ""` evaluates to `True` in Python, so this is handled identically to a genuinely missing header — a small but correct detail that shows careful reading of the exact conditional used.
- **Poor Answer:** Guesses without reasoning through Python's truthiness rules explicitly.

---

### AU11. Why might the fact that `validate_api_key` is `async def` even though it does no `await`ed I/O be worth asking about?
- **Difficulty:** Medium | **Importance:** 3
- **Expected Answer:** It's declared `async` purely because FastAPI dependency functions can be either sync or async, and `async def` is used here for consistency with the rest of the codebase's style rather than necessity — the function body does pure in-memory string comparison with no `await` anywhere. This isn't a bug or inefficiency (FastAPI handles both cases correctly), just a style observation.
- **Follow-ups:** "Would there be any performance difference if this were a plain `def` instead?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Assuming `async def` implies actual asynchronous I/O is happening internally.
- **What This Tests:** Correct understanding that `async def` is a syntactic declaration, not a guarantee of non-blocking behavior — the function's actual behavior must be checked independently.
- **Red Flags:** Assumes async functions are inherently "doing async work" without checking the body.
- **Excellent Answer:** Notes that FastAPI actually runs sync dependency functions in a thread pool executor to avoid blocking the event loop, while async ones run directly on the event loop — for a function this cheap (a string comparison), the practical difference is negligible either way, but it's worth knowing the distinction exists for cases where a dependency does real blocking work.
- **Poor Answer:** No engagement with the sync/async distinction's actual implications.

### AU12. Contrast this system's authentication model with a typical JWT-based approach. What does Velar give up, and what does it gain?
- **Difficulty:** Hard | **Importance:** 6
- **Expected Answer:** Gives up: per-user identity, expiry, revocation without a code deploy, scoped permissions, and the ability to distinguish callers at all. Gains: extreme simplicity — no token issuance flow, no signing key management, no refresh logic, trivial to implement and reason about for a purely internal, single-trust-boundary service.
- **Follow-ups:** "For what kind of deployment would Velar's current model actually be an acceptable, even correct, choice?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Treating the current model as unambiguously inferior without acknowledging any legitimate context where it would be sufficient.
- **What This Tests:** Balanced trade-off analysis rather than reflexively preferring the more sophisticated technology.
- **Red Flags:** No acknowledgment that simple shared-secret auth is ever appropriate.
- **Excellent Answer:** Notes that a single static key would be entirely reasonable for a genuinely internal, single-consumer service behind a private network boundary with no multi-tenant requirement — the actual problem here isn't that a static key exists, it's that the key is hardcoded rather than configuration-driven, and that the system's broader design (per-user analytics, feedback attribution) implies multi-tenancy that the auth model doesn't support.
- **Poor Answer:** "JWT is always better than API keys" with no situational reasoning.

---

### AU13. If you found this hardcoded API key issue during a security audit, how would you prioritize communicating it, and to whom?
- **Difficulty:** Hard | **Importance:** 7
- **Expected Answer:** This is a critical-severity finding (any client who has ever seen the source code, or guessed the fairly simple test-pattern string, has full API access indistinguishable from any other caller) — it should be flagged immediately to whoever owns the deployment, with a clear statement of impact (full undifferentiated access, no revocation possible without a code change and redeploy) and a concrete, low-effort remediation (read from `settings.VELAR_API_KEY` instead of the literal).
- **Follow-ups:** "Would you block a deployment over this finding, or ship with a documented risk acceptance?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Treating this the same as a low-severity code-quality issue rather than escalating it with appropriate urgency.
- **What This Tests:** Judgment about severity communication — a real skill distinct from finding the bug itself.
- **Red Flags:** Downplays the severity, or over-dramatizes a genuinely fixable issue into something requiring an incident response.
- **Excellent Answer:** Distinguishes the current low real-world risk (this specific test key is not attached to any sensitive production system yet, per the codebase's own "pre-production" framing) from the *pattern's* risk if deployed as-is against real user data — recommending it be fixed before any production deployment, not treated as an active incident today.
- **Poor Answer:** Either no urgency at all, or treats it as an active production incident when the system is explicitly pre-production.

---

### AU14. Is there any code path in this application where authentication is checked twice for the same request?
- **Difficulty:** Medium | **Importance:** 4
- **Expected Answer:** No — `validate_api_key` is attached exactly once per router via `dependencies=[Depends(validate_api_key)]` at `include_router` time, and FastAPI resolves each unique dependency once per request by default (dependency caching), so even if it appeared in multiple places for the same route, it would only execute once unless explicitly configured with `use_cache=False`.
- **Follow-ups:** "What would you need to do to force a dependency to run twice, and why might you want that?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Assuming dependencies always re-run every time they're referenced, without knowing about FastAPI's per-request dependency caching.
- **What This Tests:** Knowledge of a specific, sometimes-surprising FastAPI behavior (dependency result caching within a single request).
- **Red Flags:** Doesn't know dependency caching exists at all.
- **Excellent Answer:** Notes `use_cache=False` on a `Depends(...)` call would force re-execution, which could matter for a dependency with genuinely time-sensitive side effects (not applicable to `validate_api_key` itself, since it's idempotent, but a real consideration for a differently-designed dependency).
- **Poor Answer:** Doesn't know whether or how FastAPI caches dependency execution.

---

### AU15. Given everything discussed, write the single most important sentence you'd put in a security review's executive summary about this system's authentication.
- **Difficulty:** Expert | **Importance:** 9
- **Expected Answer:** Something to the effect of: "Authentication currently accepts a single hardcoded key regardless of configuration, provides no way to distinguish or revoke individual callers, and has no accompanying authorization layer — meaning any holder of the (source-code-visible) key has complete, undifferentiated access to all data in the system." A strong answer captures both the immediate defect (hardcoded key) and the structural gap (no authorization) in one crisp statement, since fixing the former alone wouldn't address the latter.
- **Follow-ups:** "What would the second sentence say?"
- **Common Mistakes:** Writing a sentence that only covers the hardcoded-key bug without mentioning the missing-authorization problem, or vice versa — both are needed for the summary to be complete.
- **What This Tests:** Ability to synthesize an entire category of findings into one precise, executive-readable statement — a genuinely different skill from finding the individual bugs.
- **Red Flags:** Produces a vague, non-actionable sentence ("authentication could be improved") that wouldn't actually inform a decision-maker.
- **Excellent Answer:** A second sentence naming the concrete, prioritized fix path (e.g., "wire the existing `VELAR_API_KEY` setting into the check immediately as a stopgap, then implement per-caller key issuance before any multi-tenant production use").
- **Poor Answer:** Restates a specific bug in isolation without synthesizing the broader pattern (missing authentication AND authorization) into an executive-level statement.
