# 02 · API Reference

All endpoints are served by the single FastAPI app defined in `app.py`. Base path prefixes come from each `APIRouter(prefix=...)` declaration; there is no global `/api` prefix.

**Authentication**: unless noted otherwise, every endpoint requires the header `X-Velar-API-Key`, checked against `settings.VELAR_API_KEY` (see `core/security.py`). A subset of endpoints — marked **Both** in the table below — additionally require `Authorization: Bearer <access token>` (a JWT obtained from `POST /auth/login` or `/auth/refresh`), resolved to a specific `User` by `core/jwt_auth.py::get_current_user`. The API key authenticates the calling application; the JWT authenticates the end user within it. Full detail in [22 · Authentication](./22-authentication.md).

> **Previously** there were two `POST /v1/categorize` routes — the real implementation in `routers/v1.py` and a dead inline stub in `app.py` that carried the intended `50/min` rate limit. The stub is removed and its rate limit now lives on the real handler (see [Known Issues §16.3](./16-known-issues-tech-debt.md#163-medium-previously-disconnected-features-dead-code-silent-no-ops--fixed)).

## 2.2 System endpoints

### `GET /health`
No auth required. Pings MongoDB (`admin.command("ping")`), checks whether the Milvus client object is non-null, and does an HTTP GET against `settings.OLLAMA_URI` with a 2s timeout.

Response `200`:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy | degraded",
  "services": { "mongodb": "connected|disconnected|error", "milvus": "connected|disconnected|error", "ollama": "connected|degraded|error" },
  "details": { "mongodb": "...", "milvus": "...", "ollama": "..." }
}
```
`status` is `"healthy"` only if all three sub-statuses equal `"connected"`; otherwise `"degraded"`. This endpoint never returns a non-200 status code itself — failures are reported in the body.

### `GET /metrics`
Standard Prometheus text exposition format, auto-generated by `prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator`. No custom metrics are defined anywhere in the codebase — only the instrumentator's defaults (request count, latency histograms, etc.) are present.

## 2.3 Authentication (`routers/auth.py`, prefix `/auth`)

Full design detail — token lifecycle, rotation, password hashing — in [22 · Authentication](./22-authentication.md). Request/response contracts:

### `POST /auth/register`
**Request** (`RegisterRequest`): `{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "at-least-8-chars" }` — `email` is lowercased before storage/lookup, `password` must be 8–128 characters.
**Response** `201` (`UserPublic`): `{ "id": "...", "email": "user@example.com", "is_active": true, "created_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" }` — never includes the password hash.
**Errors**: `409` if the email is already registered.

### `POST /auth/login`
**Request** (`LoginRequest`): `{ "email": "...", "password": "..." }`.
**Response** `200` (`TokenResponse`): `{ "access_token": "...", "refresh_token": "...", "token_type": "bearer", "expires_in": 900 }`.
**Errors**: `401` for any invalid email/password combination — deliberately the same message whether the email doesn't exist or the password is wrong. `403` if the account has been disabled.

### `POST /auth/refresh`
**Request** (`RefreshRequest`): `{ "refresh_token": "..." }`.
**Response** `200` (`TokenResponse`): a brand-new access/refresh pair; the presented refresh token is revoked in the same call (rotation — it's single-use).
**Errors**: `401` if the token is unknown, expired, or already-used (reuse of an already-rotated token also revokes every other active session for that user).

### `POST /auth/logout`
**Request** (`LogoutRequest`): `{ "refresh_token": "..." }`.
**Response**: `204 No Content`. Idempotent — revoking an unknown or already-revoked token is a no-op, not an error. Works even if the caller's access token has already expired.

### `GET /auth/me`
Requires both the API key and a valid `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`.
**Response** `200` (`UserPublic`): the calling user's own profile.
**Errors**: `401` (missing/expired/malformed/wrong-signature token), `403` (account disabled).

## 2.4 Transaction Intelligence (`routers/v1.py`, prefix `/v1`)

### `POST /v1/categorize`
**Request** (`CategorizeRequest`):
```json
{ "text": "paid 500 to swiggy" }
```
**Response** (`CategorizeResponse`):
```json
{ "merchant": "Swiggy", "category": "Food", "confidence": 0.95, "transaction_id": "666f6f2d6261722d71757578" }
```
Runs the rule engine against `payload.text`, persists the enriched transaction to `transactions`, and returns the resolved merchant/category/confidence plus the inserted document's `transaction_id` (a stringified Mongo `_id`) — pass this to `POST /v1/feedback/` to let feedback join back to a merchant. Rate-limited to 50/minute per caller. This previously raised `AttributeError` on every call (a `.get()` call on a Pydantic model, a `time.timezone.utc` typo, and placeholder object references written to Mongo instead of resolved values) — fixed, see [Known Issues §16.1](./16-known-issues-tech-debt.md#161-critical-previously-broke-the-application-or-a-whole-feature--all-fixed).

### `POST /v1/resolve`
**Request**:
```json
{ "text": "UPI/CR/3152671239/BUNDL TECHNOLOGIES/HDFC" }
```
**Response** (`ResolutionResult`):
```json
{
  "raw_text": "UPI/CR/3152671239/BUNDL TECHNOLOGIES/HDFC",
  "cleaned_text": "BUNDL TECHNOLOGIES",
  "canonical_merchant": "Swiggy",
  "confidence": 0.99,
  "is_resolved": true,
  "resolution_method": "exact_alias"
}
```
`resolution_method` is one of `exact_alias` (0.99), `substring` (0.75), or `none` (0.0). See [05 · Ingestion, Resolution & Memory](./05-ingestion-resolution-memory.md) for the cleaning algorithm.

### `POST /v1/confidence/evaluate`
**Request** (`MockModelPrediction`):
```json
{ "predicted_category": "Travel", "raw_confidence": 0.40 }
```
**Response** (`ConfidenceEvaluation`):
```json
{
  "raw_category": "Travel",
  "final_category": "Unknown",
  "confidence": 0.40,
  "is_hallucination_risk": true,
  "calibration_applied": "identity"
}
```
Rule: any `predicted_category` not in the `TransactionCategory` enum (Food, Travel, Entertainment, Bills, Friends, Education, Healthcare, Unknown) is forced to `Unknown` with `confidence: 0.0` and `calibration_applied: "none"`. Otherwise, if `raw_confidence < 0.5`, it is forced to `Unknown` with `calibration_applied: "identity"` (the calibration step is presently an identity clamp to `[0,1]`, not a real Platt/isotonic calibration — see `engines/confidence_engine.py`).

## 2.5 Memory Engine (`routers/memory.py`, prefix `/memory`)

### `POST /memory/update`
**Request**:
```json
{ "canonical_name": "Zomato", "raw_text": "paid to zomato media pvt" }
```
**Response** (`MerchantProfile`) — full schema in [03 · Data Model](./03-data-model.md#merchantprofile).

### `GET /memory/profile/{canonical_name}`
Returns the full `MerchantProfile`. `404` with `{"detail": "Profile not found in memory."}` if unseen.

### `GET /memory/state/{canonical_name}`
Lightweight variant. If unseen, returns `200` (not 404) with:
```json
{ "canonical_name": "SomeMerchant", "memory_state": "UNSEEN" }
```
Otherwise:
```json
{ "canonical_name": "Zomato", "memory_state": "TEMPORARY", "frequency": 4 }
```

## 2.6 Analytics Engine (`routers/analytics.py`, prefix `/v1/analytics`)

All analytics endpoints are scoped to `current_user.id`, resolved from the caller's JWT (`Depends(get_current_user)`) — previously a hardcoded `TEST_USER = "user_123"` shared by every caller regardless of identity; see [22 · Authentication](./22-authentication.md).

### `GET /v1/analytics/patterns/categories?days=30`
Aggregates `transactions` by `category` within `[now - days, now]`.
```json
[ { "category": "Food", "total_amount": 4230.5, "count": 12 }, ... ]
```

### `GET /v1/analytics/patterns/merchants?limit=5`
Top merchants by visit count (all-time, not time-boxed).
```json
[ { "merchant": "Swiggy", "visits": 14, "spent": 3820.0 }, ... ]
```

### `GET /v1/analytics/subscriptions`
Joins `transactions` against `behavior_patterns` (via `$lookup` on `merchant_name`) and filters to `periodicity_score >= 0.85`.
```json
{
  "active_subscriptions": 2,
  "total_monthly_burn": 698.0,
  "details": [
    { "merchant": "Netflix", "estimated_monthly_cost": 499.0, "periodicity_score": 0.94, "last_billed": "2026-07-01T00:00:00Z" }
  ]
}
```
`estimated_monthly_cost` is simply the **last observed transaction amount** for that merchant, not an average or median.

### `GET /v1/analytics/trends/mom`
```json
{ "current_spend": 8213.5, "previous_spend": 15102.0, "mom_growth_percentage": -45.61, "trend": "down" }
```
`previous_spend` is now a real aggregation over the previous calendar month (previously a hardcoded `15000.0`) — fixed, see [Known Issues §16.2](./16-known-issues-tech-debt.md#162-high-previously-security--correctness-with-real-user-impact--all-fixed). The current-month query is also now upper-bounded to the current month only (it previously summed everything from the 1st of the month onward with no end date).

### `POST /v1/analytics/anomaly/check?merchant=Uber&amount=99999`
Note: parameters are plain query parameters (`merchant: str, amount: float` as function args), not a JSON body, despite the router being a `POST`.
```json
{ "is_anomaly": true, "confidence": 0.99, "reason": "Amount is significantly higher than the typical 350.20 spent here." }
```
If no `behavior_patterns` document exists for the merchant, or its `std_dev` is `0`: `{"is_anomaly": false, "reason": "Insufficient baseline data"}`.

## 2.7 Explainability (`routers/rag.py`, prefix `/v1`)

### `POST /v1/explain`
**Request**:
```json
{ "transaction_text": "Swiggy order", "target_question": "Why was this transaction categorized this way?" }
```
**Response**:
```json
{
  "query": "Swiggy order",
  "retrieved_documents": 2,
  "result": {
    "explanation": "...",
    "confidence_in_explanation": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
    "primary_data_source": "Swiggy"
  }
}
```
If no semantic matches are found in Milvus, `result` is `{"error": "No historical behavior found to explain this transaction."}` and `retrieved_documents` is `0`. If Ollama fails or returns malformed JSON, `result` is `{"error": "Failed to generate explanation due to internal model error."}`. Full pipeline detail in [10 · RAG & Explainability](./10-rag-explainability.md).

## 2.8 Observability (`routers/observability.py`, prefix `/v1/observability`)

Both endpoints are stubs with no real implementation behind them:

### `POST /v1/observability/drift/analyze`
Always returns `{"status": "success", "message": "Drift analysis triggered successfully."}`. No Evidently AI call, no background task, no Celery integration exists in this codebase despite the docstring's claim.

### `GET /v1/observability/reports/latest`
Always returns `404` with `{"message": "No drift reports have been generated yet."}`. There is no code path that could ever generate or serve a report.

## 2.9 Feedback & Active Learning (`feedback/api_router.py`, prefix `/v1/feedback`)

`app.py` now imports and mounts `feedback.router` (`app.include_router(feedback_router, dependencies=[Depends(validate_api_key)])`) behind the same auth as every other router. Previously this was dead code from an HTTP standpoint — fixed, see [Known Issues §16.3](./16-known-issues-tech-debt.md#163-medium-previously-disconnected-features-dead-code-silent-no-ops--fixed).

### `POST /v1/feedback/`
**Request**:
```json
{ "transaction_id": "666f6f2d6261722d71757578", "original_prediction": "Unknown", "corrected_category": "Travel", "confidence": 0.40 }
```
**Response**:
```json
{ "status": "success", "feedback_recorded": true }
```
`transaction_id` should be the id returned by `POST /v1/categorize`. `process_feedback` looks that transaction up to resolve its merchant and writes a real `merchant_name` field on the feedback document (previously it stored the category prediction in a field that RAG/graph readers mistakenly queried as if it were a merchant name — fixed, see [Known Issues §16.2](./16-known-issues-tech-debt.md#162-high-previously-security--correctness-with-real-user-impact--all-fixed)). If `is_correction` is true (prediction != corrected category), a background task checks whether the retraining queue threshold has been hit.

See [09 · Feedback & Active Learning](./09-feedback-active-learning.md) for the full pipeline.

## 2.10 Batch Pipelines (`routers/pipelines.py`, prefix `/v1/pipelines`)

New router added to make previously-orphaned pipelines reachable (Phases 4, 6, 7, 8, 13 had zero callers anywhere in the repo — see [Known Issues §16.3](./16-known-issues-tech-debt.md#163-medium-previously-disconnected-features-dead-code-silent-no-ops--fixed)). Nothing schedules these automatically yet; they're manual-trigger endpoints until a cron/Celery beat is stood up.

### `POST /v1/pipelines/behavior/run`
**Request**: `{ "merchant_name": "Swiggy" }` — profiles one merchant from its transaction history. `404` if the merchant has no transactions.

### `POST /v1/pipelines/behavior/run-all`
No body. Profiles every distinct merchant in `transactions`. Response: `{ "profiled": [...], "failed": [...] }`. Run this before `/v1/analytics/subscriptions` or `/v1/analytics/anomaly/check` in a fresh environment — both depend on `behavior_patterns` being populated.

### `POST /v1/pipelines/embeddings/sync`
No body. Generates an Ollama embedding for every stored `behavior_patterns` document and upserts it into Milvus. Returns `503` if Milvus isn't connected; otherwise `{ "synced": [...], "failed": [...] }`.

### `POST /v1/pipelines/decay/sweep`
No body. Archives merchant profiles inactive 180+ days. Response: `{ "archived_count": <int> }`.

### `POST /v1/pipelines/graph/build`
No body. Rebuilds the in-memory knowledge graph from `merchant_profiles`, `behavior_patterns`, and `feedback`. Response: `{ "total_nodes": <int>, "total_edges": <int>, "density": <float> }`.

### `GET /v1/pipelines/graph/neighborhood/{merchant_name}?radius=2`
Returns the ego-graph around a merchant. Requires `/graph/build` to have been called in this process first — the graph is in-memory, not persisted.

### `POST /v1/pipelines/clustering/run`
No body. Runs the Phase 8 UMAP + HDBSCAN discovery pipeline over vectors stored in Milvus (needs at least 10 vectors; requires `scikit-learn` + `umap-learn`, imported lazily inside this handler so a missing/broken install only breaks this one endpoint). Response includes cluster count, noise count, and silhouette/Davies-Bouldin metrics.

## 2.11 Error model

There is no centralized exception handler beyond FastAPI/Pydantic defaults and SlowAPI's `RateLimitExceeded` handler. Standard shapes you will encounter:

| Status | When | Body |
|---|---|---|
| `401` | Missing `X-Velar-API-Key` header | `{"detail": "Missing X-Velar-API-Key header"}` |
| `403` | Wrong API key value | `{"detail": "Invalid or revoked API Key"}` |
| `404` | Memory profile not found; observability report not found | `{"detail": "..."}` or custom `{"message": "..."}` |
| `422` | Pydantic request validation failure | Standard FastAPI validation error array |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded | SlowAPI default body |
| `500` | Unhandled exception | Default FastAPI traceback response (`DEBUG` logging is on, so stack traces are verbose in logs) |
