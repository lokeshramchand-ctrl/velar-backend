# Velar Transaction Intelligence Engine — Engineering Documentation

Welcome to the internal engineering documentation for **Velar**, the transaction-intelligence backend. This portal is written for engineers joining the team who need to understand the system deeply enough to operate, extend, or debug it without asking around first.

> **Scope note:** Every statement in these documents is derived directly from the code in this repository as of the current `three` branch. Where the implementation is incomplete, inconsistent, or contains a defect, it is called out explicitly rather than glossed over — see [16 · Known Issues & Tech Debt](./16-known-issues-tech-debt.md). Nothing here describes aspirational or planned behavior unless the source comments themselves describe it as a future phase.

## What is Velar?

Velar ingests raw, noisy financial transaction strings (UPI references, bank SMS text, POS narrations) and turns them into structured, explainable financial intelligence: canonical merchant identity, spend category, behavioral fingerprints, anomalies, subscriptions, and natural-language explanations grounded in retrieved data.

The codebase is organized as a series of **numbered "Phases"** — this isn't a documentation invention, it's how the engineers who built it labeled the system in code comments (`# Phase 3 Endpoint`, `# Phase 9 Specific Features`, `PHASE 0 & 15: SYSTEM HEALTH & SECURITY`, etc.). This documentation set follows that same phase structure because it is the most accurate map of intent to implementation.
