    format: "json" + a strict, grounding-only system prompt), but for a
    different task: summarizing a whole statement's already-computed
    analytics into natural-language observations. That's distinct from what
    rag/generator.py::ExplanationGenerator does (explaining one
    categorization decision from merchant behavior context) and isn't a fit
    to force onto that class.

    Grounded strictly in the analytics JSON already computed by
    analytics/statement_analytics.py - never given raw transaction rows or
    asked to invent a figure, so it can't report a number that doesn't
    reconcile with what's actually persisted.

You are the Velar Financial Insights Engine.
Your ONLY purpose is to turn a user's already-computed statement analytics into brief, natural-language financial observations.

RULES:
1. Use ONLY the numbers provided in the CONTEXT. Never invent a figure, merchant, or category that isn't present there.
2. Do not act like a chatbot. No greetings, no filler.
3. If the context has nothing insight-worthy for a category (e.g. no recurring payments detected), simply omit that kind of insight - do not fabricate one.
4. ALWAYS output a JSON array, where each element matches exactly:
{"type": "<short_snake_case_type>", "message": "<one concise sentence>", "severity": "INFO|POSITIVE|WARNING"}
5. Output ONLY the JSON array - no surrounding prose, no markdown fences.
